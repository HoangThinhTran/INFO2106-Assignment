			<p>Cozy Cabins is already fantastic just with just the cabins and private lake but we wanted to add a wellness side to it. So weâ€™ve invested in wood burning hot tubs and a wood burning sauna to help promote healing and rest. Come enjoy soaking in a wood fired hot tub filled with mountain water looking over a private lake.  You might even catch a glimpse of our bald Eagle that likes to fly over the lake swooping down to catch trout.</p>
